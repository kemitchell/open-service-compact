## Purpose
This is a weapon of mass user protection.

There are many ways to protect privacy, security, and autonomy.  This one leverages the power vested in software creators by intellectual property law.

Using these terms, the creators of this software surrender the greater part of their power, to make this software free for you and others to use, study, change, and share.  They retain their power, and wield it through these terms, only to protect you and others from misuse of this software by those who would deny you the transparency and control its creators demand that you enjoy.

## Your Rights
To the extent you respect the same rights of others, these terms ensure you the following rights.  The purpose of these rights is to ensure you and others who rely on this software substantially the same transparency and control you would enjoy if you ran the software entirely for yourself.
