# Open Service Compact
an adaptable license and service agreement for open software services, inspired by the Cryptographic Autonomy License, the Blue Oak Model License, and the API Copyleft License

## Status
These terms are highly experimental.  There is not yet any "stable", versioned release.

## Structure
Unlike a traditional open source software license, Open Service Compact comes in two parts:

1.  [license terms](./TERMS.md)

2.  [acceptable service policy](./POLICY.md)

The license terms invert the usual effect of an end-user license agreement, granting everyone access to do as much as possible with the software.

The acceptable service inverts the usual effect of an acceptable _use_ policy, requiring developers, providers, and users to ensure one another's control of software, data, and processing.
